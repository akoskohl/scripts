# Useful scripts

##Â list_nested_projects_with_project_number_gcp.sh
Lists all project with project number in a folder and will include all subfolders
Project number is rarely used in GCP, this usecase is for VPC SC (Virtual Private Cloud Service Control) setup.
Our client needed a new perimeter when we implemented a new landing zone for all the "old cloud projects".
This script helped me include all the projects to new VPC SC without any manual digging for project numbers.
